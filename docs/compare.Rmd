Compare bcbio runs
==================

Step 1
------

* Use `woofr::bcbio_outputs` to generate a TSV file with the following columns:
  - `col1` - type of VCF file
     1. ensembl-batch
     2. mutect2-batch
     3. strelka2-batch
     4. vardict-batch
     5. ensemble-germ
     6. gatk-germ
     7. strelka2-germ
     8. vardict-germ
  - `col2` - path to file for final1
  - `col3` - path to file for final2

Step 2
------

* Now we can iterate through each row of the TSV according to its name, and do the comparisons per row
* If we want to run something on every VCF (i.e. files in `col2` and `col3`), we can just scatter over
  the columns twice for now.
